            <p> The aim of this platform is to connect users with each other in order to make it easier to match demand for jobs with offer.
                Using the platform, users are able to either post jobs - specifying the salary they are willing to pay - or post applications - hence
                volunteering to perform a job in exchange of a certain wage.
            </p>
            <p> Users are also able to accurately search for the job offer/application they are looking for
                by selecting different filtering criteria (such as date range, location, price range and sector).
                Moreover, users are able to book the job (either a job offer or application) they are interested in.
            </p>
            <p>
                The jobs concerned can be of the most different kinds, from the ones involving
                white-collar as well as blue-collar labor, in whatever field or sector.
            </p>
            <p>
                Comments, feedbacks and profile customization further improve the user experience
                and overall reliability of the platform.
