# flask-web-app-FastJob

## Why?
The aim of the FastJob platform is to connect users with one another in order to make it easier to match demand for jobs with offer.

## What?
Using the FastJob web app, users are able to either post jobs - specifying the salary they are willing to pay - or post applications - hence volunteering to perform a job in exchange of a certain wage.  
Users are also able to accurately search for the job offer or application they are looking for by selecting different filtering criteria (such as date range, location, price range and sector).  
Furthermore, users can  book the job post (either a offer or application) they are interested in.  
The jobs concerned can be of the most different kinds, from the ones involving white-collar as well as blue-collar labour, in whatever field or sector.  
Comments, feedbacks and profile customization further improve the user experience and overall reliability of the platform

## How?
The stack utilized to build the FastJob web application is the following:
- Server-side scripting was developed using Pythonâ€™s framework for web development Flask. Flask is based on two main components: 1\ the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) Werkzeug and 2\ the template rendering engine Jinja2.
- Client-side scripting was developed in JavaScript.
- The RDBMS utilized was SQLite. SQLAlchemy library (SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper for Python) was used to interact with the database.
- Front-end of the website (UI and styling of web pages) was developed using CSS and Bootstrap.
