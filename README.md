# flask-website-FastJob
## What?
The FastJob web application has been built using Python in PyCharm integrated development environment (IDE). 
Among the tools utilized there is Flask - a web development framework written in Python and based on the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) ‘Werkzeug’ and on the web template engine ‘Jinja2’ - whose main role is managing the routing of the web application. 
The Flask framework is also used for managing the relational database with the SQLAlchemy toolkit extension.
For what it concerns the front-end of the website (UI and styling), I have used CSS with Bootstrap.

## Why?
The aim of the FastJob platform is to connect users with one another in order to make it easier to match demand for jobs with offer.

## How?
Using the platform, users are able to either post jobs - specifying the salary they are willing to pay - or post applications - hence volunteering to perform a job in exchange of a certain wage.
Users are also able to accurately search for the job offer or application they are looking for by selecting different filtering criteria (such as date range, location, price range and sector).
Moreover, users are able to book the job (either a job offer or application) they are interested in.
Comments, feedbacks and profile customization further improve the user experience and overall reliability of the platform.
